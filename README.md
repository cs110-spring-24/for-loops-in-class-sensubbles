# For Loops Practice 

## Brief

We are going to practice our for-loops today with some exercises in class. 

## Problems 

### 1: Coin Flip

In the `coin-flip.py` file, we will write some code to accomplish the following:

1. Let’s simulate flipping 100 coins and output the results.
2. Now, let’s keep count of how many heads and tails we flipped.

### 2: Dice Roll

In the `dice-roll.py` file, we will write some code to accomplish the following:

1. Let’s simulate roll 100 dice and print out each dice value
2. Now, let’s count how many 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, and 6s were rolled

### 3: Multiples of 3 and 5

In the `multiples.py` file, let's write the following code:

1. Print out the multiples of 3
2. Now using the same loop, let’s see if we can print out the multiples of 5 too

### 4: FizzBuzz

In the `fizzbuzz.py` file, we will write some code to simulate the Fizz Buzz problem.

Instruction

1. Print out all the numbers between 1 and 30
2. If the number is a multiple of 3, instead of printing the number, print out “Fizz”
3. If the number is a multiple of 5, instead of printing the number, print out “Buzz”
4. If the number is a multiple of 15, instead of printing the number, print out “FizzBuzz”

#### Example Output:

```bash
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
```
